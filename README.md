# Enhancing Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR)

This project explores the integration of different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures with perceptual loss functions for Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR). The aim is to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) inputs, focusing on improving texture recovery and overall visual quality. The experiments involve various CNN models (such as SRCNN, EDSR, and RCAN) and evaluate the impact of combining them with perceptual losses (e.g., VGG-based) compared to traditional pixel-wise or structural similarity losses.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
Final-SISR/
├── Models/               # Contains pre-trained model weights (.pth files)
├── NoteBooks/            # Jupyter notebooks for experiments and analysis
├── Results/              # Sample super-resolved images and metric files
└── Test-Images/          # Low-resolution images for testing
```

### `Models/`
This directory stores the pre-trained weights for the various models explored in this project. You will find `.pth` files corresponding to different baselines and experimental configurations.

### `NoteBooks/`
This directory contains Jupyter Notebooks that detail the implementation, training, and evaluation of different SISR techniques:
*   **[`SISR_Bicubic_Baseline.ipynb`](./NoteBooks/SISR_Bicubic_Baseline.ipynb)**: Implements and evaluates simple Bicubic upsampling as a baseline.
*   **[`SISR_CNN_Baseline.ipynb`](./NoteBooks/SISR_CNN_Baseline.ipynb)**: Implements and evaluates baseline Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for SISR.
*   **[`SISR_GAN_Baseline.ipynb`](./NoteBooks/SISR_GAN_Baseline.ipynb)**: Explores a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based approach for SISR.
*   **[`SISR_Experiments.ipynb`](./NoteBooks/SISR_Experiments.ipynb)**: Details the experiments with different CNN architectures (e.g., EDSR, RCAN) integrated with perceptual losses and other training strategies.
*   **[`SISR_Qualitative_Analysis`](./NoteBooks/SISR_Qualitative_Analysis)**: Notebook or script for visual comparison and qualitative analysis of the results from different models.

### `Results/`
This directory contains sample output images generated by the different models and potentially text files with quantitative metrics. These can be used to visually and numerically assess the performance of the implemented methods.

### `Test-Images/`
This directory provides a set of low-resolution JPG images that can be used as input for the super-resolution models.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/Mahazzani/EnhancingSingleImageSuperResolution>
    cd EnhancingSingleImageSuperResolution
    ```
2.  **Set up your Python environment:** It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:** Based on typical SISR projects and the notebook contents, you will likely need libraries such as:
    *   PyTorch
    *   TorchVision
    *   NumPy
    *   Matplotlib
    *   Pillow (PIL)
    *   scikit-image
    *   LPIPS
    *   pytorch-msssim
    *   tqdm
    *   Jupyter Notebook/Lab

    You can usually install these using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio numpy matplotlib pillow scikit-image lpips pytorch-msssim tqdm jupyterlab
    ```
    *(Note: Check the notebooks for specific import statements to confirm all required libraries.)*

4.  **Explore the Notebooks:** Open and run the Jupyter Notebooks in the [`NoteBooks/`](./NoteBooks/) directory to understand the implementation details, training processes, and evaluation methods.

## Usage

*   The Jupyter Notebooks in the [`NoteBooks/`](./NoteBooks/) directory serve as the primary interface for running experiments, training models, and evaluating results.
*   Pre-trained models are available in the `Models/` directory and can be loaded for inference or further fine-tuning as demonstrated in the notebooks.
*   The `Test-Images/` can be used to test the super-resolution capabilities of the trained models.

## Models Explored

*   Bicubic Upsampling 
*   CNN-based models (e.g., SRCNN, EDSR variants, RCAN)
*   GAN-based models
*   Various configurations integrating CNNs with perceptual losses (detailed in `SISR_Experiments.ipynb`).

Refer to the notebooks in the [`NoteBooks/`](./NoteBooks/) directory for detailed architectures and training configurations of each model. Key notebooks include:
*   [`SISR_Bicubic_Baseline.ipynb`](./NoteBooks/SISR_Bicubic_Baseline.ipynb)
*   [`SISR_CNN_Baseline.ipynb`](./NoteBooks/SISR_CNN_Baseline.ipynb)
*   [`SISR_GAN_Baseline.ipynb`](./NoteBooks/SISR_GAN_Baseline.ipynb)
*   [`SISR_Experiments.ipynb`](./NoteBooks/SISR_Experiments.ipynb)
